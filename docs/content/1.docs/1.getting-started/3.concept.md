## Introduction

Nuxt Directus is a module for Nuxt.js that simplifies the integration of Directus into your Nuxt.js application.
It provides a set of components and helpers to make it easier to build your application.

The v5.0 version was based on the concept of writing functions to call each API endpoint itself, and "rebuilding" the SDK, as other modules like `nuxt-strapi` do.

This concept has brought some problems with it, among other things you had to define the types yourself, and of course also maintain and adapt each individual type as soon as Directus changes something, which turns out to be difficult.

In addition, many functions are missing, because building an entire SDK is not exactly easy.

Directus released a better and new SDK, which led us to integrate this SDK with its good new TypeScript support and many other features into nuxt-directus.

This means that we no longer have to maintain the types ourselves, and we can use the SDK directly

## New Concept

### Directus Clients

If you ever saw any Directus SDK example you are aware that you have to create your own clients before being able to do any operation. With `nuxt-directus`, on the other hand, each of the main composables comes with its own client, battery included! :rocket:

This means that to read a collection's data, you just have to do this:
```diff
-import { createDirectus, rest, readItems } from '@directus/sdk'
-const client = createDirectus('directus_project_url').with(rest())
-const result = await client.request(readItems('collection_name'))

+const { readItems } = useDirectusItems()
+const { data: result } = await readItems('collection_name')
```

Yes, I'm glad you noticed! üòÅ

All `read*` functions have [`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-async-data) built-in! No more double requests or hydration errors between server and client side renders by default.

::alert
The only exception is the `readMe()` function, more on that in its dedicated section.

### Naming Conventions

All functions follow the Directus SDK naming conventions, and each one will be available under their related composable that follows standard Nuxt/Vue naming conventions.

::code-group
```ts [Authentication]
const {
  client,
  acceptUserInvite,
  inviteUser,
  login,
  logout,
  passwordRequest,
  passwordReset,
  refresh,
  refreshTokenCookie,
  readMe,
  setUser,
  setTokens,
  tokens,
  user
} = useDirectusAuth()
```

```ts [Collections]
const {
  client,
  createCollection,
  readCollection,
  readCollections,
  updateCollection,
  deleteCollection
} = useDirectusCollections()
```

```ts [Files]
const {
  client,
  uploadFiles,
  importFile,
  readFile,
  readFiles,
  updateFile,
  updateFiles,
  deleteFile,
  deleteFiles
} = useDirectusFiles()
```

```ts [Items]
const {
  client,
  createItem,
  createItems,
  readItem,
  readItems,
  readSingleton,
  updateItem,
  updateItems,
  updateSingleton,
  deleteItem,
  deleteItems
} = useDirectusItems()
```

```ts [Notifications]
const {
  client,
  createNotification,
  createNotifications,
  readNotification,
  readNotifications,
  updateNotification,
  updateNotifications,
  deleteNotification,
  deleteNotifications
} = useDirectusNotifications()
```

```ts [Revisions]
const {
  client,
  readRevision,
  readRevisions
} = useDirectusRevisions()
```

```ts [Users]
const {
  client,
  createUser,
  createUsers,
  deleteUser,
  deleteUsers,
  readMe,
  readUser,
  readUsers,
  setUser,
  updateMe,
  updateUser,
  updateUsers,
  user
} = useDirectusUsers()
```
::

### Static Tokens

By default, any static token provided via [`staticToken`](/getting-started/options#statictoken) will be used, while prioritizing user authentication. This can be bypassed by using the `useStaticToken` property available in all main composables, as well give you the ability to pass your own tokens.

```ts
// only using the static token in the runtimeConfig
const { readSingleton } = useDirectusItems<MySchema>({ useStaticToken: true })
const { data: globals } = await readSingleton('globals')

// bypassing the static token, only using the currently authenticated user
const { readItems } = useDirectusItems<MySchema>({ useStaticToken: false })
const { data: posts } = await readItems('posts')

// using a custom static token
const client = useDirectusRest({ useStaticToken: 'my-super-long-token' })
```

This is also true for both other clients: `useDirectusGraphql`, `useDirectusRealtime`.

### TypeScript Support

Type support is provided to each main composable, making sure to instruct its built-in client and provide full type support to each function.

```ts
import type { MySchema, Post } from '~/types'

const { createItem, readItems, updateItem } = useDirectusItems<MySchema>()

const { data: posts, pending: pendingPosts, refresh: refreshPosts } = await readItems('posts', {
  query: {
    fields: ['title', 'id', 'slug', 'content']
  }
})

const newPostData = ref<Partial<Post>>({})

async function createContent () {
  await createItem('posts', newPostData.value)
  refreshPosts()
}

const postId = ref<Post['id']>(posts.value?.[0].id || '')
const updatePostData = ref<Partial<Post>>({})

async function updateContent () {
  await updateItem('posts', postId.value, updatePostData.value)
  refreshPosts()
}
```

::alert{type=danger}
`useAsyncData` type support is still under development
